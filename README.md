# Sweet or Salty

> A Vue.js project

I just want to play around with Vue.js.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production with minification
npm run build

# Run unit tests
npm test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
